# Regression test for the run_program() child dereferencing the pppdb
# pointer that ppp_safe_fork() had already tdb_close()d (and freed): the
# child died of SIGSEGV before reaching execve, so ip-up/ip-down silently
# never ran while the parent daemon carried on looking healthy. Only
# reachable when pppd is built with TDB (--enable-multilink) and a hook
# script actually exists -- run_program() returns before forking if the
# script is missing, which is why no other test in this suite reaches it.
#
# Also checks PPP_SCRIPT_INSTANCE names the script actually being run
# (link_down() used to run auth-down labelled as "auth-up").
#
# Builds without TDB still run the test: the scripts must run and be
# labelled correctly there too, only the pppdb crash can't happen.
#
# On illumos the hooks currently fail to exec (see HOOK_EXEC_FAILED below);
# that exact failure is reported as XFAIL, anything else still fails.
