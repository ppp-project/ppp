# OUTBOUND CONNECTIONS
# Here you should add your userid password to connect to your providers via
# pap. The * means that the password is to be used for ANY host you connect
# to. Thus you do not have to worry about the foreign machine name. Just
# replace password with your password.
# If you have different providers with different passwords then you better
# remove the following line.
#hostname	*	password

# INBOUND CONNECTIONS
#client		hostname	<password>	192.168.1.1

# If you add "auth login -chap +pap" to /etc/mgetty+sendfax/login.config,
# all users in /etc/passwd can use their password for pap-authentication.
#
# Every regular user can use PPP and has to use passwords from /etc/passwd
#*	hostname	""
# UserIDs that cannot use PPP at all. Check your /etc/passwd and add any
# other accounts that should not be able to use pppd! Replace hostname
# with your local hostname.
