# If you need to set up multiple serial lines then copy this file to
# options.<ttyname> for each tty with a modem on it.
#
# The options.tty file will assign an IP address to each PPP connection
# as it comes up. They must all be distinct!
#
# Example:
# options.ttyS1		for com2 under DOS.
#
# Edit the following line so that the first IP address
# mentioned is the ip address of the serial port while the second
# is the IP address of your host
#
hostname-s1:hostname
