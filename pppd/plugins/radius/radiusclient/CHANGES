This file only documents fixed bugs and new features.. well, if I am not
too lazy...

01-06-99	Added support for RFC compliant accounting request digest
		calculation.
		Added new attributes and value defines to radiusclient.h.
		Deleted an fclose at the wrong place (could lead to SIGSEGV).
		Add newlines when constructing message from Reply-Message
		attributes.
		Output warning message when --enable-radius-116 is enabled.

07-19-98	Changed licensing terms (GPL -> BSD style).
		Added pointer to pppd patches in patches/README.

03-06-98	Added patch patches/radiusd-1.16.accounting.diff.

02-10-98	IMPORTANT! Changed the name of the "clients" config file
		directive and the file name itself to "servers". This should
		better reflect its content. Furthermore "servers" is now
		installed mode 600 and not 644. Thanks go to Tilman
		Mueller-Gerbes <tmg@suse.de> for pointing this out.

01-15-98	Fixed two bugs in lib/sendserver.c, rc_random_vector:
			- file descriptor leak (found by Michael Lausch)
			- vector was not increased with each read

01-14-98	Portability changes for NetBSD and BSDI. It compiles cleanly
		on both platforms, now. But I haven't been able to test the
		resulting executables. Many thanks go to Meno Abels
		<Meno.Abels@Technical.Adviser.com> for providing accounts on
		a NetBSD and BSDI machine. Furthermore I'd like to thank
		Dave Burgess <burgess@cynjut.neonramp.com> for his help.

Dezember 1997, 	Lots of portability changes. 
January 1998	Switched to autconf, automake and libtool.
		Change all occurences of radclient to radiusclient (in file and 
		directory names). 
		Added shared libradiusclient.
		Removed check for login_radius in lib/config.c.	
		Fixed bug in src/radacct.c which lead to a SIGSEGV
		when calling ttyname(3).
		Added support for longer passwords (mostly untested).
		Integrated includes/config.h into the configure script.

09-15-96	intermediate release: changed my email address and homepage.
			included the new (working) pppd patch.

06-01-96	patch to pppd included, contributed by Matjaz Godec
		<gody@elgo.si>, heavily changed and broken by me.

06-01-96	ppptraffic is gone, it wasn't really useful as the kernel
		ppp clears the stats right when the device goes done.
		Maybe it's possible to add this functionality to pppd
		directly.

05-13-96	rc_mksid is back in libradiusclient.a

05-12-96	Fixed some bugs in the files MCONFIG and Makefile (reported by
		Matjaz Godec <gody@elgo.si>).

05-12-96	rc_avpair_add, rc_avpair_new, rc_avpair_assign have a new
		last argument: the length of the attribute. This can
		normally always be zero and is needed only in the special
		case when you want to send raw data strings which might
		contain a \0 character.

05-11-96	rc_map2id now preceeds its argument with /dev/ if neccessary

05-03-96	I changed the tabbing style, so from now on tabs are 4
		characters so that there's more space for full blown and
		complicated if, switch, etc. structures. Remember this when
		you look at the source.

05-03-96	improved error checking in a few places and changed
		logging so that now everything goes into syslog.
		facility is configurable in config.h (SYSLOG_FACILITY)

05-02-96	added admin logins: you can now change the radiusclient
		config file from remote. much is still missing. to use this
		feature define a RADIUS user with a service type of
		Administrative.

05-01-96	MERIT_GRANDFATHER compatability define removed again,
		it's simply broken. You HAVE to compile Merit radiusd
		without this define for outbound and admin logins to work.

05-01-96	config.c rewritten, the syntax of more than one authserver
		or acctserver directive in radiusclient.conf is no longer
		supported. instead mutliple servers have to be specified
		in one line seperated by comma.

05-01-96	added outbound support to radlogin, usably via telnet or
		pseudo tty (rport sets this tty up on a remote host).

03-19-96	added support for /etc/nologin, new config option "nologin"
		in radiusclient.conf

03-18-96	Linux (>=1.3.x): added support for /dev/urandom for more
		secure user passwords

03-17-96	normal usage messages are now seperate in src/messages.h
		(thanks go to Migs, who pointed out that this would
		be usefull)

03-15-96	added SCP define, to derive a service type from a user
		name prefix and supply it to the RADIUS server

03-14-96	added RADIUS_116 define, accounting should now "work" with
		Livingston radiusd v1.16.

		cleaned up the enviroment handling, the global setenv was
		a mess.

01-07-95	added ppptraffic which reads out the ppp statistics just
		like pppstats.
		this works only for ppp as slip has no such statistics
		(besides packets sent/received which is not very
		 useful).
