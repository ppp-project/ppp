.SH NAME
pppoe\-discovery \- perform PPPoE discovery
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pppoe\-discovery
[
.I options
]
.br
.BR pppoe\-discovery " { " \-V " | " \-h " }"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBpppoe\-discovery\fR performs the same discovery process as
\fBpppoe\fR, but does not initiate a session.
It sends a PADI packet and then prints the names of access
concentrators in each PADO packet it receives.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-I " interface"
.RS
The \fB\-I\fR option specifies the Ethernet interface to use.
Under Linux, it is typically eth0 or eth1.
The interface should be \(lqup\(rq before you start
\fBpppoe\-discovery\fR, but should \fInot\fR be configured to have an
IP address.
The default interface is eth0.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-D " file_name"
.RS
The \fB\-D\fR option causes every packet to be dumped to the specified
\fIfile_name\fR.
This is intended for debugging only.
.RE
.TP
.B \-U
.RS
Causes \fBpppoe\-discovery\fR to use the Host-Uniq tag in its discovery
packets.
This lets you run multiple instances of \fBpppoe\-discovery\fR and/or
\fBpppoe\fR without having their discovery packets interfere with one
another.
You must supply this option to \fIall\fR instances that you intend to
run simultaneously.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-S " service_name"
.RS
Specifies the desired service name.
\fBpppoe\-discovery\fR will only accept access concentrators which can
provide the specified service.
In most cases, you should \fInot\fR specify this option.
Use it only if you know that there are multiple access concentrators
or know that you need a specific service name.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-C " ac_name"
.RS
Specifies the desired access concentrator name.
\fBpppoe\-discovery\fR will only accept the specified access
concentrator.
In most cases, you should \fInot\fR specify this option.
Use it only if you know that there are multiple access concentrators.
If both the \fB\-S\fR and \fB\-C\fR options are specified, they must
\fIboth\fR match.
.RE
.TP
.B \-A
.RS
This option is accepted for compatibility with \fBpppoe\fR, but has no
effect.
.RE
.TP
.BR \-V " | " \-h
.RS
Either of these options causes \fBpppoe\-discovery\fR to print its
version number and usage information, then exit.
