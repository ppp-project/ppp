 * Paths are controlled by configure. Typically, one would pass the following options
 * to configure:
 *    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
 *
 * Note that if the prefix variable do control all the other directory variables, e.g
 * sysconfdir is ${prefix}/etc. Setting prefix to /usr, you'll have to override
 * sysconfdir with /etc to avoid installing config files into /usr/etc.
 *
 * In addition, there are three explicit variables that has overrides via configure:
 * - PPPD_RUNTIME_DIR, set by --with-runtime-dir=<dir>
 * - PPPD_LOGFILE_DIR, set by --with-logfile-dir=<dir>
 * - PPPD_PLUGIN_DIR, set by --with-plugin-dir=<dir>
