# This sample code shows you one way to modify your setup to allow automatic
# configuration of your resolv.conf for peer supplied DNS addresses when using
# the `usepeerdns' option.
#
# In my case I just added this to my /etc/ppp/ip-down.local script. You may need to 
# create an executable script if one does not exist.
